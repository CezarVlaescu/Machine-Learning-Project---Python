## Media Galaxy Product Tracker with Machine Learning

# Overview

The Media Galaxy Product Tracker is an enhanced Python application designed to help users track the availability of products on the Media Galaxy website. This project incorporates machine learning to provide more accurate predictions of product availability, enabling users to receive timely notifications when desired products become available.

# Features

* User-Friendly GUI: An intuitive graphical user interface for easy interaction.
* Predictive Availability Analysis: Machine learning models analyze historical data to predict future product availability.
* Dynamic Notification Strategy: Predictive models optimize the timing of availability checks and customize notification strategies based on user behavior.
* Email Notifications: Users receive detailed email notifications when the machine learning model predicts that a tracked product is likely to become available.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/media-galaxy-product-tracker.git
cd media-galaxy-product-tracker

2. Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:

bash

python gui.py

# Usage

Launch the application.
Enter the product URL and your email address.
Click the "Track Availability" button.
Receive email notifications when the machine learning model predicts that the product is likely to become available.

# Machine Learning Integration

1. Historical Data Collection: The application utilizes historical data to train machine learning models. Historical data includes features such as product availability, time of day, and other relevant information.

2. Feature Extraction: The extract_features function extracts relevant features from the product's webpage to be used as input for machine learning predictions. Features may include product price, category, and rating.

3. Availability Predictor: The AvailabilityPredictor class encapsulates the machine learning model. It is trained on historical data and can predict future product availability based on extracted features.
